      <h1><a name='top'>A Visual Guide to Graph Traversal Algorithms</a></h1>

      <p>Graph Traversal Algorithms are one of the building blocks of Computer Science. Here we
      explore the topic of Depth and Breadth with the goal of helping readers appreciate the underlying concepts and see
      the extensibility of each algorithm by <strong>visualising</strong> each algorithm and how it traverses a graph.</p>
