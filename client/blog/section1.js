      <h1>A Visual Guide to Graph Traversal Algorithms</h1>

      <p>Graph Traversal Algorithms are one of the building blocks of Computer Science. Here we
      explore the topic and present visual demonstrations of variations of Depth and Breadth
      First Search with the goal of helping readers appreciate the underlying concepts and see
      the extensibility of each algorithm and what they can be used for!</p>
